# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This repository contains the implementation of fundamental machine learning algorithms using only NumPy.
The goal is to understand how each algorithm works internally.

## Implemented Algorithms

## Objectives

- Understand the math and logic behind each model.
- Write clean and documented Python code.
- Learn how to tune hyperparameters manually.

## Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
